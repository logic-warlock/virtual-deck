# virtual-deck
A virtualized deck for playing card games like MTG, Pokemon, Flesh &amp; Blood, etc.

## The Problem

**I HATE shuffling decks**, playing card games is AMAZING! Shuffling decks though, not so much. Especially TCG games that can have 100+ cards within the deck. Other decks can take up a TON of time if they require a lot of shuffling, and I've decided not to play certain MTG decks solely because I'd need to shuffle alot.

## The Solution

I believe a solution would be to NEVER shuffle your deck. It'd stay in a specific order of your choosing, alphabetical, by card type, cost, etc. so that it's easy to navigate. Then, you'd use this application to virtualize your deck.

It could also keep track of your graveyard/discard pile.

It'd be used to tell you what card to draw next, and keep track of the order of the deck.

Once a game is over you just re-add your cards back to the order that fits you best.
